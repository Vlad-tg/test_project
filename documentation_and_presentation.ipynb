    "### Project Overview\n",
    "The goal of this project was to develop a regression model that predicts house prices based on various features. By completing this project, I aimed to gain hands-on experience with different stages of the machine learning workflow, including data preprocessing, model selection, training, evaluation, and hyperparameter tuning. This project can serve as a foundation for future machine learning projects and as a portfolio piece to demonstrate my skills.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Methodology\n",
    "1. Data Collection:\n",
    "   - I utilized the popular \"California Housing dataset\" available in the `sklearn.datasets` module.\n",
    "   - The dataset contains various features such as average income, housing average age, and rooms per household.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Data Exploration:\n",
    "   - Basic statistics were calculated to understand the distribution and characteristics of the data.\n",
    "   - Missing values were identified, and data visualizations were used to gain insights into the feature distributions.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Data Preprocessing:\n",
    "   - Missing values were handled using techniques such as mean imputation.\n",
    "   - Feature scaling was performed to ensure that all features were on the same scale.\n",
    "   - The dataset was split into training and testing sets using the `train_test_split` function from `sklearn.model_selection`.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Model Selection and Training:\n",
    "   - I experimented with different regression models, including linear regression, ridge regression, LASSO, DecisionTreeRegressor and RandomForestRegressor.\n",
    "   - The chosen model was trained using the training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Model Evaluation:\n",
    "   - The model's performance was assessed using metrics such as mean squared error (MSE), root mean squared error (RMSE), and R-squared score.\n",
    "   - Cross-validation was performed to evaluate the model's performance on different subsets of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Model Tuning:\n",
    "   - The model's hyperparameters were fine-tuned using techniques like grid search.\n",
    "   - The model's performance was re-evaluated after tuning the hyperparameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Results Visualization:\n",
    "   - Plots were created to visualize the relationship between the actual house prices and the predicted house prices.\n",
    "   - Feature importance analysis was conducted to identify features that had the most significant impact on house prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Results\n",
    "After training and evaluating the regression model, the following results were obtained on the test set:\n",
    "- Mean squared error (MSE): 0.2552543867748214\n",
    "- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): 0.5052270645707941\n",
    "- R-squared Score: 0.8052101359092668\n",
    "- Cross-Validation:\n",
    "  - Mean Squared Error: 0.43274651702561595\n",
    "  - Root Mean Squared Error: 0.6578347186228589\n",
    "  - R-squared Score: 0.6495400766487739\n",
    "- Best Params: {'random_state': 420}\n",
    "\n",
    "The results indicate that the RandomForestRegressor model outperformed other models such as LinearRegression, Lasso, Ridge, and DecisionTreeRegressor in terms of predictive performance. It achieved a significantly lower MSE, RMSE, and higher R-squared score on the test set. The cross-validation scores demonstrate the model's consistency across different subsets of the data.\n",
